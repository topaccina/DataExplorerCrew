The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the annual production trends in Alabama over the recent years. The data reveals a significant upward trend in production, with outputs of 44,000 units in 2019, increasing to 66,000 units in 2020, and reaching 112,000 units in 2021. This represents a robust growth trajectory, more than doubling production from 2019 to 2021. The sharp rise in 2021, in particular, indicates a substantial acceleration in production capabilities or demand, which management could capitalize on for strategic planning and resource allocation.
